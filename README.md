# List Pagination and Filtering

### Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree - Project 2

This project uses unobtrusive JavaScript to add pagination links to a long list of students, displaying only 10 students per page.
This will work for a list of any length.
A select menu is available to choose how many results are displayed per page.

A real-time search feature is added to allow users to find full or partial matches to their search.
The pagination links are updated based on the search results.
If the user's search does not match any names in the list, all students will be hidden and a "No Results" message will appear.
If the user does not type anything into the input field, the entire list will be displayed.
